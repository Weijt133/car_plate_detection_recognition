## üìñ Project Overview

This repository implements a two-stage deep-learning pipeline for vehicle license-plate detection and recognition. We leverage transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained YOLOv5 model on real-world images and then adapt it to low-visibility (‚Äúhazy‚Äù) conditions.

## 1. Introduction & Objectives

Accurate automatic detection and recognition of vehicle license plates play a vital role in traffic monitoring, parking management, and intelligent transportation systems. The goals of this project are:

- Quickly build a license-plate detector using a pre-trained YOLOv5 model  
- Fine-tune on a small real-world dataset (1,001 images) to achieve ‚â• 99% detection accuracy  
- Apply transfer learning to improve robustness under low-visibility (hazy) conditions

## 2. Data Annotation

- We used [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) (or a custom script) to draw bounding boxes around plates.  
- Annotation formats supported: Pascal VOC XML or YOLO TXT.
