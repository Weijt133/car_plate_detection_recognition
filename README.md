> **Group Name**: Hyperpioneers  
> **Course**: COMP9444 (Master of AI, UNSW)  

## üìñ Project Overview

This repository implements a two-stage deep-learning pipeline for vehicle license-plate detection and recognition. We leverage transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained YOLOv5 model on real-world images and then adapt it to low-visibility (‚Äúhazy‚Äù) conditions.

## 1. Introduction & Objectives

In this project, we delve into the exciting world of computer vision and optical character recognition (OCR) to solve a practical yet challenging problem: building a real-time, end-to-end system that not only accurately locates vehicle license plates but also decodes their alphanumeric content under diverse environmental conditions. We chose to integrate the high-precision, single-pass YOLOv5 detector‚Äîoptimized for rapid plate localization without redundant computations‚Äîwith a CRNN-based OCR module for sequence-level character recognition.

- **Object Detection**:
Leveraging Ultralytics‚Äô YOLOv5 framework, we conducted a two-stage fine-tuning: first on clear (‚Äúground truth‚Äù) samples, then adapting to haze by freezing early convolutional layers and retraining on mixed clear/foggy datasets.
- **Text Recognition**:
The CRNN model combines CNN feature extraction with bidirectional LSTM sequence modeling and CTC decoding. We trained and validated this OCR module on cropped plate regions to maximize character-level accuracy.

## 2. Data Annotation

- Our dataset is derived from the website provided in the project list: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/p3jr4555tf/1. This dataset provides two groups of pictures containing license plates, one of the groups is "Ground Turth images", the other is "New Hazy dataset".
- "Ground Turth images" group has 1001 clear images, those images has 3 types: ".jpg", ".png" and ".JPG". The "New Hazy dataset "group also has 1001 images, it consists of the same pictures but has a fog effect with just one ".png" type.
